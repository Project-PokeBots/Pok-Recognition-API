# PokeRécognition-API
 A simple Pokémon image classifier made using [Keras](https://keras.io) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).

## How to Setup
1. Install python and the required pypi packages.
2. Scrape your Pokémon images in two folders named `dataset/training` and `dataset/validation`, sort the subfolders labeled by dex numbers.
3. Use the `trainer.py` file to create a keras model.
4. Use the `main.py` file to test your keras model.
